      <h3 class="font-normal font-sans break-normal text-gray-600 dark:text-white pt-2 text-xl md:text-2xl">6:43 am</h3><p class="py-3">I woke up 20 min before my alarm. The basement, my hole of redemption, is too dark to distinguish between day and night. I felt weird. I wasn't sure if I feel better or worse than when I went to bed. I was not sure if something healed.</p><p class="py-3">I have to be quiet today about any kind of relationship issues. I cannot push anymore, yet I have to push. I have to push myself, push my emotions down. I won't be healing myself this way. What I did wrong, the way I have acted before, it needs to come out. I need to get rif of it. How can I fix it without letting it out, I need to breath deeply. </p><p class="py-3">I want to do some things differently than yesterday. I need to be the better man. I won't save my marriage if I am unappealing. I will workout today. I won't save my marriage if I am disgruntled, upset and angry. I will greet her with a genuine smile today and do so everytime. I cannot save my marriage if I am not caring for the ones I love. I will show her that I am interested in her and her life by politely asking her what went well and what did not go so well.</p><p class="py-3">I can hear movement upstairs. I can hear our daughter. It is time to get her ready for school. </p><p class="py-3">One last thought. Remind myself of the oxygen mask in a commercial airliner. I have to put the mask on myself before I can help others.</p><h3 class="font-normal font-sans break-normal text-gray-600 dark:text-white pt-2 text-xl md:text-2xl">10:44 am</h3><p class="py-3">I took a run, showered. We had a nice talk. Unrelated to our issues. I noticed that I had to put an effort not to stray into "prohibited" territory. I think it went well. Yesterday and today we exchanged more friendly gestures than we had done before. That feels good. I smile at her, she smiles at me. We have even shared a laugh or two. I think my only chance is to present my best self to her, show her that I unconditionally support her and the family. That I go out of my way to make life better for her and that I am there when she needs help. I feel ok. </p><h3 class="font-normal font-sans break-normal text-gray-600 dark:text-white pt-2 text-xl md:text-2xl">4:46 pm</h3><p class="py-3">The day was ok so far. We have had some time a apart. I have tried not to push at all. I think it went well. I made lunch, we ate together. We had a good conversation. I felt happy about it. I am trying to understand for myself, where I am currently. Am I just following? Am I the stalker? I need to become the one that is hard to get again. She needs to realize what she would loose and she needs to realize that I can change, that I have changed and that I commit to that change. I need to focus on myself so that I can be the most desireable option out there.</p><h3 class="font-normal font-sans break-normal text-gray-600 dark:text-white pt-2 text-xl md:text-2xl">9:00 pm</h3><p class="py-3">The day went ok. Towards the evening things turned a little. My feelings went south. I had more clenched stomach again. I have a hard time controlling the thought of never being close to my wife ever again. When you need it the most, the one person that gives you a warm feeling, that gave you your children, that gives you a reason to be, a goal to pursue, when this person leaves you are done. You are done. </p><p class="py-3">I have to watch a lot of movies and series just to keep my mind off of things. To stay sane. Tonight I will try to work a bit more on my static site generator tool.</p><h3 class="font-normal font-sans break-normal text-gray-600 dark:text-white pt-2 text-xl md:text-2xl">9:45 pm</h3><p class="py-3">She just came downstairs to say good night. I really appreciated that. I did slip a little. I did ask about how it is going to be between us from now. I haven't touched her for days now. I am very unsure about what I can do, what I cannot do and how to act from now on. I am so lost. My life feels like it is slipping away from me. The carpet is being pulled away beneath my feet. 
We talked about the living situation and I told her that I'd support her with anything and that I would move out, onto someones couch, to make her comfortable and give her the space she needs.</p><p class="py-3">I am so scared. </p>
